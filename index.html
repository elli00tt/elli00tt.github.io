  As an artist, I find inspiration in the unexpected — from the subtle texture of stone to the vibrant glow of neon color.

    <p>
      For this assignment we were tasked to convert our initials into animals and or plants using two 
      different color harmonies. My initials are <b>ELD</b>. In the beginning, we started with a 
      detailed pencil project where I excelled in my ability to get really detailed and use the value 
      of lights and darks. For the second half of this assignment I chose the color harmonies of 
      <em>Warm Colors</em> and <em>Triadic Colors</em>. My warm color piece came out very successful 
      with everything popping and mixing extremely well with a clean finish. While my triadic piece 
      was a lot more experimental, the neon colors were something very unique that many people loved.
